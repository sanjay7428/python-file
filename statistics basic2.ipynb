    "Calculation: For an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. For an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "Definition: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (multimodal), or no mode (no value occurs more than once).\n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can distort measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "The mean is particularly sensitive to outliers because it takes into account the magnitude of all values. A single extreme value can significantly pull the mean towards it, making it unrepresentative of the typical value of the dataset.\n",
    "The median, on the other hand, is less affected by outliers since it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. However, in datasets with extreme outliers, the median may still be influenced, especially if the outliers are numerous.\n",
    "The mode may not be directly affected by outliers, as it represents the most frequent value(s) in the dataset. However, in skewed distributions or datasets with multiple modes, outliers can alter the mode(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can also impact measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "The range, which measures the difference between the maximum and minimum values, can be greatly influenced by outliers, especially if they are extreme.\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation, which quantify the spread of data around the mean, can be inflated by outliers, particularly if they are far from the mean. Outliers increase the squared differences between data points and the mean, leading to larger variance and standard deviation values.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset of exam scores: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 120.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the outlier (120), the mean score would be: (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) / 5 = 80.\n",
    "With the outlier included, the mean becomes: (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 120) / 6 = 86.67.\n",
    "The median, however, remains the same with or without the outlier: 80.\n",
    "The range is significantly affected by the outlier, increasing from 50 to 120.\n",
    "The variance and standard deviation are also impacted, increasing due to the presence of the outlier, indicating greater variability in the dataset."
