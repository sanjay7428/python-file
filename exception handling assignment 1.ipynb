    "### Q1. **What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception in Python:**\n",
    "An **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program during execution. It occurs when the program encounters an unexpected situation, such as trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or attempting to use an undefined variable. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing, and the exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "1. **Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Occur during the execution of the program.\n",
    "   - Can be caught and handled using `try-except` blocks.\n",
    "   - Examples include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, etc.\n",
    "   - Can be anticipated and managed through proper exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
    "   - Occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not follow the proper syntax of the language.\n",
    "   - They are detected at **compile time** before the program runs.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors need to be corrected in the code itself before execution.\n",
    "   - Examples include missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Exception Example\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax Error Example\n",
    "# print(\"Hello\"  # Missing closing parenthesis (SyntaxError)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. **What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is **not handled**, the program terminates abruptly, and an error message is displayed. The program will stop execution, and no further code will be executed after the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example where exception is not handled\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "result = x / y  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError and the program will stop\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"This will not be printed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since the exception is not handled, the program raises a `ZeroDivisionError` and stops. The statement `\"This will not be printed.\"` is never executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. **Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements used to catch and handle exceptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try`**: The block of code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "2. **`except`**: The block of code that runs when an exception is raised.\n",
    "3. **`else`** (optional): Executes if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "4. **`finally`** (optional): Executes no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    a = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division was successful!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This will always execute.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "This will always execute.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The exception is caught by the `except` block.\n",
    "- The `else` block is skipped because the exception was raised.\n",
    "- The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. **Explain with an example: `try`, `else`, `finally`, `raise`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try`**: Contains code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "2. **`else`**: Runs if no exception is raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "3. **`finally`**: Always executes, even if an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "4. **`raise`**: Used to manually raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = x / y\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Division successful! The result is {result}\")\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"This will always execute.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if y == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Y should not be zero.\")  # Manually raising an exception\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the function\n",
    "divide(10, 0)  # Will raise an exception and execute `finally` block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "This will always execute.\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"script.py\", line 15, in <module>\n",
    "    divide(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"script.py\", line 13, in divide\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Y should not be zero.\")\n",
    "ValueError: Y should not be zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `try` block attempts to divide by zero and raises an exception.\n",
    "- The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "- The `finally` block always executes.\n",
    "- The `raise` statement raises a custom exception after the division attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. **What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Exceptions**:\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exceptions. By creating custom exceptions, we can provide more meaningful error messages and handle specific cases that are unique to our application or domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need Custom Exceptions?**\n",
    "- To handle errors in a way that is specific to the application's needs.\n",
    "- To make the code more readable by giving specific names to errors.\n",
    "- To provide better debugging information and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InvalidAgeError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "def register_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 18:\n",
    "        raise InvalidAgeError(\"Age must be 18 or older to register.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Registration successful!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    register_age(15)\n",
    "except InvalidAgeError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Age must be 18 or older to register.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- A custom exception `InvalidAgeError` is created to handle age-related validation.\n",
    "- When the age is less than 18, the custom exception is raised with a specific error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. **Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a Custom Exception:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Custom exception class\n",
    "class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function to simulate a bank withdrawal\n",
    "def withdraw_funds(balance, amount):\n",
    "    if amount > balance:\n",
    "        raise InsufficientFundsError(\"Insufficient funds for the withdrawal.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        balance -= amount\n",
    "        print(f\"Withdrawal successful! New balance: {balance}\")\n",
    "    return balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the custom exception\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    balance = 1000\n",
    "    balance = withdraw_funds(balance, 1500)  # Will raise the custom exception\n",
    "except InsufficientFundsError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Insufficient funds for the withdrawal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The custom exception `InsufficientFundsError` is defined to handle cases where the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.\n",
    "- The exception is raised in the `withdraw_funds` function, and it is caught in the `try-except` block to provide a meaningful error message."
